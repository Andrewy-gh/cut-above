Welcome to TS Migrate! :D

This script will migrate a frontend folder to a compiling (or almost compiling) TS project.

It is recommended that you take the following steps before continuing...

1. Make sure you have a clean git slate.
   Run `git status` to make sure you have no local changes that may get lost.
   Check in or stash your changes, then re-run this script.

2. Check out a new branch for the migration.
   For example, `git checkout -b lenny--ts-migrate` if you're migrating several folders or
   `git checkout -b lenny--ts-migrate-src` if you're just migrating src.

3. Make sure you're on the latest, clean master.
   `git fetch origin master && git reset --hard origin/master`

4. Make sure you have the latest npm modules installed.
   `npm install` or `yarn install`

If you need help or have feedback, please file an issue on Github!

Your default tsc path is ./node_modules/.bin/tsc.
